# DiscordBot
A bot for my discord server.

Uses this api : https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py for discord access

Currently the bot will do the following:

!help     prints all current commands
!ip       prints the servers IP -> I use this as the server also hosts a Minecraft Server
!version  prints the current Minecraft Server Version
!info     prints stats about the user, this includes how many of each command they have used, and how mayn "secrect commands" they have found

Code needs a rework, as it was hacked together in one night to get working, will split into diffrent files over time and make more effiecent
