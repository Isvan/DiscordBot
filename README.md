# DiscordBot
<p>
A bot for my discord server.

Uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) for discord access and [mcstatus](https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus) for minecraft server querying.
		 
Currently the bot will do the following:

* !help     prints all current commands
* !ip       prints the servers IP -> I use this as the server also hosts a Minecraft Server
* !version  prints the current Minecraft Server Version
* !info     prints stats about the user, this includes how many of each command they have used, and how mayn "secrect commands" they have * found

This code needs more work as it was written in one night. It will be split into diffrent files over time and be made more efficient.
